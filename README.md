# MEMS1055: Computer Aided Analysis of Transport Phenomena
Taught by Dr. Givi who is intimidatingly smart and unapologetically funny

This course covers various numerical methods for solving transport problems (e.g., fluid dynamics, heat transfer, diffusion problems...). It requires familiarity with differential equations, fluid mechanics, and doing calculations via programming. Otherwise, this course will be harder than it already is.

Some numerical methods taught include:
- Finite difference methods (forward, backward, central)
- Runge-Kutta
- Shooting method
- Spectral methods

The finite difference methods are the most frequently used. Many kinds of FDMs exist, differing in: discretization error order, gridpoints considered per iteration, number of dimensions, explicit/implicit schemes, and direction of differencing (upwinding, central, weird ones like leap-frog).

I'm making this repository because this course is really hard. This is by far the most difficult course I've taken in my undergraduate career. At the same time, I'm really enjoying this course. I'm proud of the code I write for each homework assignment and kinda wanna show it off. If you are a current student of this course who is looking for homework answers online - you probably won't find it here. Dr. Givi seems to assign homework assignments on a whim and the problems differ every semester.

All the homework assignments are written in Python, and the final project is in C++.

If you want to run the Python scripts, you will need Numpy and Matplotlib packages.
