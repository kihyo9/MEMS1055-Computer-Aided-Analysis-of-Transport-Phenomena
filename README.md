# MEMS1055: Computer Aided Analysis of Transport Phenomena
taught by Dr. Givi who is intimidatingly smart and unapologetically funny

This course covers various numerical methods for solving transport problems (e.g., fluid dynamics, heat transfer, diffusion problems...). It requires familiarity with differential equations, fluid mechanics, and doing calculations via programming. Otherwise, this course will be harder than it already is.

Some numerical methods taught include:
- Finite difference methods (forward, backward, central)
- Runge-Kutta
- Shooting method
- Spectral methods

I'm making this repository because this course is really hard. This is by far the most difficult course I've taken in my undergraduate career. At the same time, I'm really enjoying this course. I'm proud of the code I write for each homework assignment and kinda wanna show it off. If you are a current student of this course who is looking for homework answers online - you probably won't find it here. Dr. Givi seems to assignment homework assignments on a whim and the problems differ every semester.
